# Base-rate-neglect-and-neural-computations-for-subjective-weight-in-decision-under-uncertainty
We investigated the neurocomputational substrates critical to people's biased estimation on the probability of events


In Yang & Wu (2020, PNAS), we investigated base-rate neglect -- a well-known bias in probability judgment -- at the computational and neural implementaion levels. We include the behavioral data and analysis code here. Our behavioral analysis focused on estimating how human participants weight prior and likelihood information about probability of reward in a lottery decision task and how subjective weights differed from the ideal Bayesian. Our neural analysis focused on identifying neural representations of subjective weight estimated from behavior.
